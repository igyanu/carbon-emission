## 📦 Installation

## ⚙️ Usage

1. Input activity data (distance traveled, energy consumed, etc.)
2. The system calculates emissions using standard emission factors
3. View summaries, charts, and trends on the dashboard
4. Use insights to reduce your carbon footprint 🌱

---

## 📐 Emission Calculation Logic

Emissions are calculated using the formula:

```
Emission = Activity Data × Emission Factor
```

Emission factors are based on standard environmental datasets.
